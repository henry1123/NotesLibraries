# NotesLibraries for LotusScript 

We have collected a lot of Libraries for LotusScript (Notes/Domino) that did or did not store in Github.com website.

1. NotesFTP from Â© 2000 Paul D. Ray (pray@babson.edu)
2. Lotus Notes Data Exporter - https://github.com/KDRS-SA/lotus-notes-data-exporter
3. Generic Excel Import - marpie - (c) 2011, a12d404.net - BSD License 
https://github.com/marpie/lotusnotes/tree/master/GenericExcelImport
4. notespy - A native python interface to Lotus Notes, using a nicer wrapper around the C++ API. - Darren Garvey - notespy.sf.net - https://github.com/darrengarvey/notespy
notespy is a clean and very efficient way to access Lotus Notes databases from Python. The library uses the Notes C++ API directly (well, behind a nicer C++ API) to make manipulating large amounts of data painless. Quicker than LotusScript!

If you have any comments, please let us know, thanks.
