# NotesLibraries for LotusScript 

We have collected a lot of Libraries for LotusScript (Notes/Domino) that did not store in Github.com or did.

1. NotesFTP from Â© 2000 Paul D. Ray (pray@babson.edu)
2. Lotus Notes Data Exporter - https://github.com/KDRS-SA/lotus-notes-data-exporter

If you have any comments, please let me know, thanks.
