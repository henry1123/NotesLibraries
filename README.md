# NotesLibraries for LotusScript 

We have collected a lot of Libraries for LotusScript (Notes/Domino) that did or did not store in Github.com website.

## Library List
1. NotesFTP from © 2000 Paul D. Ray (pray@babson.edu)
2. Lotus Notes Data Exporter - https://github.com/KDRS-SA/lotus-notes-data-exporter
3. Generic Excel Import - marpie - (c) 2011, a12d404.net - BSD License

## Other reference document
1. Shared object wrapper and script to make IBM/Lotus Notes work on Ubuntu 12.04 and greater. - Peter Rosenberg - https://github.com/PetRose/lotus-notes_gtk2.23.3
2. Using python control Lotus Notes (Notes COM Object) sample code - 子風 z-Wind - https://github.com/z-Wind/Lotus_Notes_Python
3. notespy - A native python interface to Lotus Notes, using a nicer wrapper around the C++ API. - Darren Garvey - notespy.sf.net - https://github.com/darrengarvey/notespy
notespy is a clean and very efficient way to access Lotus Notes databases from Python. The library uses the Notes C++ API directly (well, behind a nicer C++ API) to make manipulating large amounts of data painless. Quicker than LotusScript! https://sourceforge.net/projects/notespy/
4. Lotus-Notes-Exporter - A demo project on how to export and process Lotus Notes databases for integration with external services (LotusScript Agent & JAVA) - Alexandre Rafalovitch (arafalov) https://github.com/arafalov/Lotus-Notes-Exporter https://www.outerthoughts.com/2011/01/bulk-processing-lotus-notes-database/
